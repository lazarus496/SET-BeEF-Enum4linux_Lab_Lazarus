This repository documents a hands-on penetration testing lab that demonstrates how common misconfigurations in SMB services, web browsers, and human behavior can be identified and exploited within a controlled environment. The assessment focuses on the use of widely adopted security testing tools, including enum4linux, SMBClient, the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), and the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF). All testing is conducted against a Metasploitable target system using Kali Linux to simulate realistic attack scenarios while maintaining ethical and academic standards.

The lab begins with enumeration using enum4linux to gather critical information from SMB services, such as anonymous (null session) access, user and group details, shared resources, password policies, and the underlying operating system and Samba version. SMBClient is then used to validate these findings by directly interacting with the discovered shares, confirming anonymous access, listing available directories, and demonstrating read and write permissions on exposed resources such as the /tmp share.

To highlight the human element of security, the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is used to simulate social engineering attacks by cloning legitimate websites and harvesting credentials through fake login pages. This demonstrates how user trust and lack of awareness can be exploited even when technical controls are present. Complementing this, BeEF is employed to showcase browser-based exploitation by hooking victim browsers via JavaScript, performing browser fingerprinting, and executing controlled client-side attacks to illustrate the risks posed by insecure or outdated browsers.

The key findings from this lab include enabled anonymous SMB access, exposed and writable shares without authentication, the presence of a vulnerable Samba version, weak or missing password protection policies, and increased exposure to browser-based attacks through social engineering techniques. Together, these issues demonstrate how individual weaknesses can be chained to achieve deeper system compromise.

This project is intended strictly for educational and ethical hacking purposes. All activities were performed in a controlled lab environment on intentionally vulnerable systems, and the techniques demonstrated should never be used on systems without explicit authorization. Overall, the lab reinforces the importance of secure system configuration, regular patching, and user awareness, showing how both technical vulnerabilities and human factors play a critical role in an organization’s security posture.
